## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below. This guide will help you set up your environment, install the necessary dependencies, and ensure everything is configured correctly.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. If you haven't installed Git, you can download it from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your current directory to the project directory.

    ```
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**: It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project. This helps to keep the dependencies required by different projects separate and organized.

    ```
    python -m venv myenv
    or
    python3 -m venv myenv
    
    ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Before installing the dependencies, you need to activate the virtual environment. The command to activate the environment depends on your operating system.

    - On Windows:

        ```
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

        ```
        source myenv/bin/activate
        ```

5. **Install Dependencies**: Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the project dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Updating Dependencies

After installing any new packages or updating existing ones, remember to update the `requirements.txt` file. This ensures that the project's dependencies are documented and can be easily installed by others.

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

Once you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:

```
deactivate
```
